# Setup a LAMP Stack on Windows 11, with WSL2, Ubuntu 22.04, native systemd Services and VS Code optimizations

This project is intended to guide the developer through the installation, configuration and _workflow optimization_ of a _LAMP Stack_ that is targeted on Windows 11, with WSL2 and **Ubuntu 22.04**, with a _LAMP Stack_ implemented via _native systemd services_ instead of containers/virtualization.

## Why use Win11 in the first place, and why native systemd services instead of containers?

During my years of on-field experience, I've created _my own workflow_ that allows a developer to:

1. Use MS Windows, if he/she's comfortable with it
2. Use the _Linux Terminal_ with all the performance optimizations made possible by **WSL2**, and specifically use **Ubuntu** as its userbase is consistent: if you encounter a problem, or need a specific package, there's a good probability that you will find informations on how to fix the issue or complete the task in minutes
3. Use native _systemd services_ like **Apache** and **MariaDB** instead of relying on _Containers_ like Docker. Although, in fact, _Docker performance is nearly identical to native performance in Linux_, (references: [1](https://dominoweb.draco.res.ibm.com/reports/rc25482.pdf) and [2](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/21889053/what-is-the-runtime-performance-cost-of-a-docker-container)) my **personal opinion** is that, if a Client has its own VM or shared hosting or voodoo server where _Dockerization is technically not feasible_, then **development workflow, staging and test should be as much as possible adherent to what will the production environment be**. That said, this means having a set of tools to allow the developer _to quicky deploy_ on various types of production configurations (PHP versions, mainly).

## Installation instructions

> Automated Install

If you want to automatically install everything, open a `PowerShell` window with **elevated privileges** (_Run ad Admin_)

```powershell
Set-ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned -Scope CurrentUser -Force; $desktopPath = [Environment]::GetFolderPath('Desktop'); $url = 'https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mauriziofonte/win11-wsl2-ubuntu22-guide/main/install/win11.ps1'; $outputPath = Join-Path -Path $desktopPath -ChildPath 'test.ps1'; (New-Object System.Net.WebClient).DownloadFile($url, $outputPath); & $outputPath
```

The automated installer will:

- Download itself to your Desktop
- Start the installation process
- Reboot the computer after a pre-setup phase where WSL will be enabled
- Continue the installation of Ubuntu after the reboot

Tips:

1. If you want to run the automated install on **Windows 10** (not tested!), just append `-SkipWindowsVersionCheck` at the end of the one-liner install
2. If you want to test a **Dry Run** of the script (no modifications made to your PC), just append `-DryRun` at the end of the one-liner install

> Manual Install

Manual installation instuctions are provided in two languages:

- [Manual installation instructions in Italian](/docs/it/SETUP-IT.md)
- [Manual installation instructions in English](/docs/en/SETUP-EN.md)

## Uninstall

To completely remove Ubuntu 22.04 from your computer, open a `PowerShell` window and run:

```powershell
wsl --unregister Ubuntu-22.04
```

If you used the automated install method, you'll also need to remove a specific _HKCU_ Registry Key. To do so, open a `PowerShell` window with **elevated privileges** (_Run ad Admin_) and run:

```powershell
Remove-Item -Path "HKCU:\Software\WSL2Setup" -Force -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue | Out-Null
```

## Mantainers

Currently, the sole maintainer is @mauriziofonte - more maintainers are quite welcome, as the guides are lenghty, and the automated installer is quite complex and difficult to debug without having to create & destroy WSL instances every time.
